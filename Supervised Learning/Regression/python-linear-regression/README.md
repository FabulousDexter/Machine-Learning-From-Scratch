# Linear Regression from Scratch

A simple implementation of linear regression built from scratch in Python to predict salary based on years of experience. This is a beginner-friendly ML project to understand the basics of machine learning.

## What This Project Does

Predicts employee salaries based on their years of experience using the formula: `Salary = w Ã— Experience + b`

## How to Run

1. **Install Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Open the notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/linear_regression.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run all cells** to see the model train and make predictions!
