A comprehensive machine learning project implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch for FIFA 24 player segmentation, featuring custom centroid initialization, iterative optimization, and real-time visualization with performance comparison to scikit-learn.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project demonstrates K-Means clustering implementation for unsupervised learning on FIFA 24 players dataset to segment players based on performance statistics. Key features include:

- **Custom K-Means Implementation**: Built from scratch using only NumPy and basic Python
- **Lloyd's Algorithm**: Complete implementation with convergence detection
- **Real-time Visualization**: PCA-based 2D clustering visualization during training
- **Performance Comparison**: Benchmarking against scikit-learn implementation
- **Player Segmentation**: Meaningful clustering of players by skill profiles

## üìä Dataset

**FIFA 24 Male Players Dataset:**
- **Total Players**: ~17,000+ professional football players
- **Features**: 7 performance metrics (age, overall, PAC, SHO, DRI, DEF, PHY)
- **Preprocessing**: Z-score normalization and missing value removal

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter scikit-learn
```

### Running the Project

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd "Unsupervised Learning/k-means-clustering"
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook k-means-clustering.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run all cells** to see the complete analysis and real-time clustering visualization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

### Custom K-Means Algorithm

The implementation includes a complete `KMeansClustering` class with core methods:

- **`initialize_centroids()`**: Random centroid initialization within data bounds
- **`calculate_distances()`**: Euclidean distance calculation from points to centroids
- **`assign_labels()`**: Assign each point to nearest centroid
- **`update_centroids()`**: Update centroids as cluster means
- **`fit()`**: Main training method with real-time PCA visualization

### Mathematical Foundation

**Objective Function:**
```
J = Œ£·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÅ·µè Œ£‚Çì‚ààC·µ¢ ||x - Œº·µ¢||¬≤
```

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Initialize k centroids randomly
2. Assign points to nearest centroids
3. Update centroids as cluster means
4. Repeat until convergence (centroid movement < 1e-4)
